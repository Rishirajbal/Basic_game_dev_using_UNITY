# Basic Game Development Using Unity

## Overview
This repository contains a simple obstacle avoidance game developed using Unity. The player controls a character that must navigate and escape various obstacles. The game demonstrates fundamental Unity game development concepts including physics, collision detection, and player controls.

## Technologies Used
- **Unity Engine**: The primary game development platform used for this project
- **C#**: The programming language used for scripting game behavior
- **MonoBehaviour**: Unity's base class for scripts that allows interaction with the game engine
- **Physics System**: Unity's built-in physics engine for handling collisions and movement
- **Rigidbody Components**: Used for physics-based movement and collision detection
- **Prefab System**: For creating reusable game objects
- **Particle Systems**: For visual effects (if applicable)

## Game Controls
- **A**: Move left
- **D**: Move right
- **W**: Stop movement

## Game Mechanics
The game features a player-controlled object that must navigate through a series of obstacles. The objective is to survive as long as possible by avoiding collisions with these obstacles. The game likely increases in difficulty over time, challenging the player's reflexes and strategic thinking.

## Installation
1. Download the zip file from this repository
2. Extract the contents to your preferred location
3. Run the "box game.exe" file to start playing

## Development Setup
To modify or extend this game:
1. Download and install Unity Hub from [unity.com](https://unity.com/)
2. Install the appropriate Unity version (recommended: 2021.3 LTS or newer)
3. Clone this repository or download the source files
4. Open the project folder in Unity

## Connecting All-Hands AI to GitHub (How This Repository Was Created)

This README was created with the assistance of All-Hands AI. Here's how the AI was connected to GitHub:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**: First, I created a new repository on GitHub named "Basic_game_dev_using_UNITY"

2. **Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
   - Went to GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
   - Created a new token with appropriate repository permissions
   - Copied the generated token for later use

3. **Connect All-Hands AI to GitHub**:
   - Logged into the All-Hands AI platform
   - Navigated to the integration settings
   - Selected GitHub as the integration service
   - Pasted the previously generated PAT
   - Authorized All-Hands to access my GitHub account

4. **Repository Management**:
   - All-Hands AI was then able to clone the repository
   - Upload files to the repository
   - Create and modify files like this README
   - Commit changes directly to the repository

This workflow allows for seamless collaboration between AI assistance and GitHub version control, making it easier to document and manage game development projects.

## Future Improvements
- Add more levels with increasing difficulty
- Implement a scoring system
- Add sound effects and background music
- Create additional player characters with unique abilities

## Acknowledgements
This project was created as a learning exercise for Unity game development. The README was generated with assistance from AI to provide comprehensive documentation.
